# Implement plan

1. Project Setup

- Create a Git Repository:
  - Create a new repository on GitHub (or your preferred platform).
- Local Development Environment:
  - Docker:
  - Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml (refer to the example provided earlier).
  - Build and run the Docker containers.
- WordPress Installation:
  - Install WordPress within your Docker container.
  - Install and activate the WooCommerce plugin.
- Theme Selection:
  - Choose and install a suitable WooCommerce theme.
- Initial Commit:
  - Add all files and folders to Git (except for .git, .docker, and potentially large media files).
  - Commit the initial changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "Initial project setup with Docker").
  - Push the changes to your remote repository on GitHub.

2. Development Workflow

- Create Feature Branches:
  - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix (e.g., feature/product-page-design, bugfix/cart-issue).
- Develop and Test Locally:
  - Make changes to your theme files, plugins, and PHP code within your Docker container.
  - Thoroughly test your changes locally.
- Commit Changes Frequently:
  - Commit your changes regularly and write clear and concise commit messages.
- Push to Remote Branch:
  - Push your local branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

3. Code Review and Collaboration

- Create Pull Requests:
  - Create a pull request on GitHub to merge your branch into the main branch.
- Code Review:
  - Request code reviews from other developers on your team.
  - Provide constructive feedback and address any identified issues.
- Merge and Deploy:
  - Once the code review is complete and all issues are resolved, merge the branch into the main branch.
- Trigger Kinsta Deployment: Utilize Kinsta's Git integration to automatically deploy the code from the main branch to your staging environment.

4. Staging and Production

- Staging Environment:
  - Kinsta provides a staging environment for testing.
  - Deploy the code from the main branch to the staging environment.
- Production Deployment:
  - Thoroughly test in the staging environment.
  - Deploy the code from the main branch to the production environment using Kinsta's deployment features.

5. Maintenance and Updates

- Regular Updates:
    - Create a new branch for each update (e.g., hotfix/wordpress-update).
    - Update WordPress, WooCommerce, and plugins within your Docker container.
    - Test updates thoroughly in the staging environment.
- Deploy updates to production.
- Security:
Implement security measures within your Docker environment.
Keep your server software, plugins, and Docker images updated.
Regularly review security logs.
